# üî• CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED!

## Root Cause Found!
The debug output revealed the smoking gun:
```
drw-r--r--    1 app      nodejs           0 Aug 21 17:19 master_order.db
```

**`master_order.db` was being created as a DIRECTORY (`drw-`) not a FILE (`-rw-`)!**

This explains **every single error**:
- ‚ùå `rm: '/app/data/master_order.db' is a directory`
- ‚ùå `unable to open database "/app/data/master_order.db": unable to open database file`
- ‚ùå `Error parsing connection string: /app/data/master_order.db`

## Critical Fix Applied

### 1. Directory Detection and Removal
```bash
if [ -d "/app/data/master_order.db" ]; then
    echo "üö® ERROR: master_order.db exists as directory! Removing..."
    rm -rf /app/data/master_order.db
fi
```

### 2. Force File Creation
```bash
sqlite3 /app/data/master_order.db "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS _temp (id INTEGER); DROP TABLE _temp;"
```

### 3. Schema Path Fix
- Schema found at `./server/prisma/schema.prisma`
- Added working directory change to `/app/server`
- Added multiple schema location detection

## Deploy Immediately!

```bash
./update-unraid.sh
docker logs -f master-order
```

## Expected Success Output

You should now see:
```
üö® ERROR: master_order.db exists as directory! Removing...
üîß Creating SQLite database file...
‚úÖ Database file created successfully
‚úÖ Schema file found at server/prisma/schema.prisma
‚úÖ Database accessible, running migrations...
‚úÖ Migrations completed successfully
```

**This was a filesystem/volume mounting issue causing the database to be created as a directory instead of a file. The fix forces proper file creation and should resolve ALL Prisma connection issues!**

## Why This Happened
- Volume mounting configuration issue
- Filesystem permissions problem
- Directory vs file creation conflict

**This should be the FINAL fix that gets your container working!**
