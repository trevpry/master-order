# URGENT: Fix for Persistent Dotenv Error

## The Issue
You're still getting the dotenv error because the container is using the old Docker image. The fixes I made need to be built into a new image.

## Immediate Fix Steps

### Step 1: Stop the Current Container
```bash
# Stop and remove the failing container
docker stop master-order
docker rm master-order
```

### Step 2: Verify You Have the Updated Files
Make sure you have the latest versions of the files with my fixes:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /mnt/user/appdata/master-order-build/master-order

# Check if dotenv is in server package.json
grep -A 10 '"dependencies"' server/package.json | grep dotenv
# Should show: "dotenv": "^16.5.0",

# If dotenv is NOT shown, you need to update the file
```

### Step 3: Update server/package.json (if needed)
If dotenv is missing, edit the file:

```bash
# Edit the package.json file
nano server/package.json
```

Find the dependencies section and add dotenv:
```json
  "dependencies": {
    "@prisma/client": "^6.8.2",
    "axios": "^1.9.0",
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "dotenv": "^16.5.0",
    "express": "^4.21.2",
    "multer": "^2.0.1",
    "node-fetch": "^2.7.0",
    "prisma": "^6.8.2",
    "socket.io": "^4.8.1",
    "sqlite3": "^5.1.7",
    "xml2js": "^0.6.2"
  },
```

Save the file (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter).

### Step 4: Force Rebuild the Image
```bash
# Remove the old image first
docker rmi master-order:latest

# Rebuild with no cache to force fresh installation
docker build --no-cache -t master-order:latest .
```

### Step 5: Verify the Build Includes Dotenv
```bash
# Check that the build completed successfully
docker images master-order

# Test that dotenv is installed in the new image
docker run --rm master-order:latest sh -c "cd /app/server && npm list dotenv"
# Should show dotenv@16.5.0 or similar
```

### Step 6: Check Data Directory Permissions
```bash
# Ensure the data directory has correct permissions
ls -la /mnt/user/appdata/master-order/data/
chown -R 99:100 /mnt/user/appdata/master-order/
chmod -R 755 /mnt/user/appdata/master-order/
```

### Step 7: Recreate Container in Unraid
Go to the Unraid WebUI â†’ Docker tab and recreate the master-order container with the same settings.

## Alternative: Quick Manual Fix

If the build is still not working, you can manually add dotenv to a running container temporarily:

```bash
# Start the container in interactive mode to test
docker run -it --rm master-order:latest sh

# Inside the container:
cd /app/server
npm install dotenv
exit
```

Then commit this change to a new image:
```bash
# Get the container ID from the last run
docker ps -a | head -2

# Commit the changes to the image
docker commit <container-id> master-order:latest
```

## What Should Happen

After rebuilding, the container should start successfully with logs like:
```
ðŸš€ Starting Master Order application...
ðŸ“Š Checking database schema...
âœ… Database created and migrated
ðŸ”§ Generating Prisma client...
ðŸŒŸ Starting application server...
Server running on port 3001
WebSocket server ready for real-time notifications
```

**No more dotenv errors!**

## If You're Still Having Issues

1. **Double-check the package.json file:**
   ```bash
   cat server/package.json | grep -A 15 dependencies
   ```

2. **Make sure you're in the right directory:**
   ```bash
   pwd  # Should show the project root with Dockerfile
   ls -la Dockerfile
   ```

3. **Try a completely clean build:**
   ```bash
   docker system prune -f
   docker build --no-cache -t master-order:latest .
   ```

The key is making sure the Docker image is rebuilt with the updated package.json that includes dotenv!
